# GenJAX Tutorial Visualization Images

This directory contains visualization images for the GenJAX tutorial chapters.

## Image Generation Guide

All images should be generated by running the code snippets from the tutorial chapters. Below is a guide for each required visualization.

### Chapter 2: Your First GenJAX Model

**Location in tutorial:** After line 265 (bar chart code)

**Image to generate:** `first_model_outcome_distribution.png`
- **Source code:** Lines 244-265 in `02_first_model.md`
- **What it shows:** Bar chart of four outcomes (HH, HT, TH, TT) from 10,000 simulations
- **Expected appearance:** Four bars of roughly equal height (~2500 each)
- **How to generate:**
  ```python
  # Run the code from lines 244-265
  plt.savefig('content/genjax/images/first_model_outcome_distribution.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
  ```

### Chapter 4: Conditioning and Inference

**1. Prior vs Posterior Comparison**

**Location in tutorial:** After line 458 (visualization code for taxicab prior/posterior)

**Image to generate:** `taxicab_prior_posterior.png`
- **Source code:** Lines 415-458 in `04_conditioning.md`
- **What it shows:** Two side-by-side bar charts showing probability distribution before and after observing "blue"
- **Expected appearance:**
  - Left: Prior showing 85% green, 15% blue
  - Right: Posterior showing ~59% green, ~41% blue
- **How to generate:**
  ```python
  # Run the code from lines 415-458
  plt.savefig('content/genjax/images/taxicab_prior_posterior.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
  ```

**2. Base Rate Effect Curve**

**Location in tutorial:** After line 540 (base rate exploration code)

**Image to generate:** `taxicab_base_rate_effect.png`
- **Source code:** Lines 513-540 in `04_conditioning.md`
- **What it shows:** Line plot showing how posterior probability changes with different base rates
- **Expected appearance:** Curved line from bottom-left to top-right, with marked point at 15% base rate showing ~41% posterior
- **How to generate:**
  ```python
  # Run the code from lines 513-540
  plt.savefig('content/genjax/images/taxicab_base_rate_effect.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
  ```

### Character Images (Already Referenced)

The following character images are referenced but don't need to be generated from code:
- `chibanyplain.png` - Chibany character standing
- `chibanylayingdown.png` - Chibany character laying down

These should be simple illustrations of the cat character Chibany used throughout the tutorial.

## Image Specifications

All generated images should follow these specifications:
- **Format:** PNG
- **DPI:** 150 (good balance of quality and file size)
- **Size:** Matplotlib default (typically 8x5 inches for single plots, 12x5 for side-by-side)
- **Style:** Clean, professional appearance matching the tutorial's friendly tone
- **Colors:** Use the color schemes defined in the code (e.g., '#4ecdc4' for green, '#6c5ce7' for blue)

## Quick Generation Script

To generate all visualization images at once, run:

```bash
cd /home/jausterw/work/tutorials/amplifier_play/probintro
python scripts/generate_genjax_visualizations.py
```

(Note: This script would need to be created based on the code snippets above)
