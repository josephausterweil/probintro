A <em>random variable</em> is a function that maps from the set of possible outcomes to some set or space. The output or range of the function could be the set of outcomes again, a whole number based on the outcome (e.g., counting the number of Tonkatsu), or something more complex (e.g., the world&rsquo;s friendship matrix, an 8-billion by 8-billion, binary matrix where $N$ where $N_{1,100}=1$ if person 1 is friends with person 100). Technically the output must be <em>measurable</em>. You shouldn&rsquo;t worry about that distinction unless your random variable&rsquo;s output gets really, really big (like continuous).

<p>
The <em>conditional probability</em> is the probability of an event conditioned on knowledge of another event. Conditioning on an event means that the possible outcomes in that event form the set of possibilities or outcome space. We then calculate probabilities as normal within that <em>restricted</em> outcome space. Formally, this is written as $P(A \mid B) = \frac{|A|}{|B|}$, where everything to the left of the $\mid$ is what we&rsquo;re interested in knowing the probability of and everything to the right of the $\mid$ is what we know to be true.
